# Social Networks in College: Facebook100 Modularity 

Compares how university social networks are affected by different variables, mainly gender, student/faculty status, major, and the size of one's network. Finds the modularity of each university's network for each of these variables and plots them against the total network sizes. Utilizes Python packages Scipy, Seaborn, iGraph, and MatPlotLib via Jupyter notebook.

###### Utilizes the [Facebook100 dataset developed by Professor Mason Porter](http://masonporter.blogspot.com/2011/02/facebook100-data-set.html)
